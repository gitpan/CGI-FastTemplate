	- original version; created by h2xs 1.18
	- first public release (rewrite)

1.01  Tue Sep 15 10:01:44 EDT 1998

	- added clear(SCALAR) which clears the scalar from the parsed
	hash. i.e. 
		$tpl->clear("FOO");	## equivalent to:
		$tpl->assign(FOO=>"");
	
	- made $v='' not undef in parse() to avoid spurious warnings
	Thanks to: Benjamin Low <b.d.low@unsw.edu.au>

	- added method define_nofile() (alias: define_raw) which allows
	you to define a template without having to create a separate file
	for your template.
